I am really into the NBA so I decided to do a project involving NBA team stats and standings.
I haven't ever built anything in React before so I was really proud of this app.
The home page pulls from an NBA Api to collect data on each team and display standings for each conference. On the side of the standings there is a list of teams. If you click on a team, you are taken to a page showing just that team's stats. It also hits another Api to grab that teams previous game scores to display. At the top you can click on the Standings Home button to return to the main screen.

I was able to utilize many css features such as transitions, grid layouts, flex layouts, and other css properties. I also used many of the React features that we learned about in class such as a Router, useState, useEffect, custom Hooks, functional Components, and more. I wanted to use the useContext hook but I started by just passing props and then I ran out of time to impliment Context. That is something I would impliment later when refactoring code.

I feel like there definitely is some refactoring I could do to clean up some of the code, but for the most part I am really proud of the project and how the code is written.
